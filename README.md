# COLOR-SORTING-MACHINE
COLOR SORTING MACHINE USING ARDUINO AND SERVO MOTOR
I developed a color sorting machine using Arduino, which included a servo motor-controlled conveyor system. This project involved programming the Arduino microcontroller to not only analyze and sort objects based on color but also to control the movement of objects along a conveyor belt using a servo motor. The machine utilized sensors to detect object colors, and based on the analysis, the servo motor adjusted the conveyor belt's speed or direction to sort the objects into different categories. This project enhanced my skills in microcontroller programming, servo motor control, sensor integration, and automation in a practical setting.

Skills Gained:
Arduino Programming for Automation
Servo Motor Control for Conveyor Systems
Sensor Integration and Calibration
Color Sensing Algorithms
Object Sorting Mechanisms
Practical Experience in Machine Design
